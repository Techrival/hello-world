# hello-world
First repository.. I'm following guides.github.com

Greetings, from Japan (I'm an American). I'm trying to learn how to code in Swift. Just got a MBP 16" a couple of weeks ago and I dove into Sean Allen's iOS Swift Programming beginner's course. Anyhow, I know that Git and Github are very important so I took a brief detour, due to twitter, to learn a little bit more about Git and Github.. thus, I'm here.
